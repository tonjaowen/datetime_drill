# datetime_drill
This was a Python drill for the Tech Academy.
We were asked to create a program for a Portland based company that wanted to 
know if other branches of their company, located in New York and London, were open or closed based on the
current time in Portland.

Guidelines included:
1. Use Python 2.7 IDLE
2. Use DateTime Module
3. Execute program on the shell
